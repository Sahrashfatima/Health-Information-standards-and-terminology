# Health-Information-standards-and-terminology
üéØ Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, I was able to:
	‚Ä¢	Understand the fundamentals of health information standards and terminologies.
	‚Ä¢	Analyze key terminologies (SNOMED CT, ICD, LOINC) and standards (HL7, FHIR).
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate how standards impact interoperability across EHRs and healthcare systems.
	‚Ä¢	Apply terminologies and standards in the development of real-world healthcare applications and ETL pipelines.

 üõ†Ô∏è Project:
‚úÖ ETL Pipeline with FHIR and SNOMED CT:
	‚Ä¢	Developed a full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, FHIR APIs, and SNOMED-CT terminology.
	‚Ä¢	Extracted patient and condition data from OpenEMR, applied clinical hierarchies, and posted structured data to a Primary Care EHR system.
	‚Ä¢	Focused on data cleaning, transformation, and secure API authentication with OAuth 2.0.
	‚Ä¢	Implemented LOINC-coded observations and SNOMED-coded procedures for clinical decision support and research insights.
 ‚úÖ BPMN in Healthcare
	‚Ä¢	Used BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) to map hospital workflows including emergency department admissions and interdepartmental communication.
	‚Ä¢	Reflected on benefits and limitations of BPMN in complex clinical settings and its integration with DSS and EHRs for quality improvement.
 UML and Class Diagrams
	‚Ä¢	Modeled key healthcare entities to EHR modules and patient systems.
 üß† Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
	‚Ä¢	SNOMED CT, LOINC
	‚Ä¢	Python (requests, JSON handling, OAuth2)
	‚Ä¢	MySQL, OpenEMR
	‚Ä¢	Camunda BPMN Modeler
	‚Ä¢	UML Tools
	‚Ä¢	REST APIs, OAuth 2.0
 üìö Key Skills Gained
	‚Ä¢	Health data standardization and semantic interoperability.
	‚Ä¢	EHR data extraction using FHIR-compliant APIs.
	‚Ä¢	Clinical terminology mapping using SNOMED CT & LOINC.
	‚Ä¢	BPMN process modeling in healthcare scenarios.
	‚Ä¢	Software design using UML class diagrams.
	‚Ä¢	Secure API integration with OAuth 2.0 and error handling.
	‚Ä¢	Visualizing healthcare data for clinical insights.
