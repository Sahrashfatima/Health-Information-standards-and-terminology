# Health-Information-standards-and-terminology
I learned how to use FHIR and SNOMED standards to build a healthcare ETL pipeline. For our project, we created a website that connects to FHIR APIs, extracts patient data from OpenEMR, transforms it using SNOMED codes, and loads it into a Primary Care EHR system. I used Python, SQL, and JSON to manage data and support healthcare interoperability.
